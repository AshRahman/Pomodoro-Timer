### Pomodoro-Timer

This is a pet project for ensuring productivity and flow.
Pomodoro technique in short is way of focusing on a task on hand for 25 mins at a time then taking 5 mins of break. It is that simple. While i can use
my mobile for that, but thats boring and non productive lmao. And i needed to learn python like really badddd. So im using this project for builfing the timer
as a way of learning python and using top notch python concepts(like i can code any) and make it harder that it needs to be.
also if you want to know the full Pomodoro technique refer to this Wiki link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique 
Also Pomodoro means Tomato in italian ü§å so have a Pomodoro for good fortune üçÖ
